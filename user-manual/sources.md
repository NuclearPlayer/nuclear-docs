Nuclear has three kinds of provider plugins: metadata, streaming, and lyrics. They are shown in the **plugins** section, available from the sidebar menu on the left.

* **Metadata providers** are what powers the search engine. You can select them from the **plugins** section, or from the dropdown next to the search box. The default one is **Discogs**, as it provides the best results for most users, and is also the fastest. The selected metadata source will return information about artists and albums when you start a search.
* **Streaming providers** are where the actual music comes from. The default streaming provider is **Youtube**. When you add a track to the queue, the streaming provider will try to find a matching stream for you to listen to (with the exception of local tracks). Note that some providers have a limited availability of music.&#x20;
* **Lyrics providers** are only used to display the song lyrics, which you can go to from the sidebar menu. The default one searches on several websites and returns whatever it finds.
